Hello! I'm Eldo Macuácua, hailing from Inhambane, a province in Mozambique fondly referred to as the "Land of Good People.

I am an innovative, reliable, committed, and results-driven person with solid principles and integrity. I bring enthusiasm, polished communication abilities, exceptional organizational talents, and a keen eye for detail.

I am currently undertaking my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Engineering (2024–2028) at [Parul University, India]((https://paruluniversity.ac.in/)).


Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
